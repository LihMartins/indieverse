# Project: A Journey of Resilience and Determination

## Introduction

This project is a testament to the power of resilience, a story of a phoenix rising from the ashes. It is the second attempt at building a webpage from scratch, born from the lessons learned from a previous endeavor that didn't go as planned. You can find the initial attempt [here](https://lihmartins.github.io/CodeProjectStudies/).

### The Journey

The journey was not easy. After grappling with the complexities of the first project, the decision to start over was not taken lightly. But the love for the project concept and the determination to bring it to life fueled the resolve to try again.

These projects are more than just practice projects; they represent the first steps into the world of coding. Each step was taken with a deeper understanding, each line of code written with valuable information gathered along the journey.

### The Struggle and Triumph

The path was fraught with challenges. Striving for perfection, ensuring that every detail was in place, and making the webpage functional across all types of devices was no small feat. But every struggle, every moment spent cracking the code, was worth it.

### More Than Just a Webpage

This project is more than just a webpage. It is a symbol of perseverance, a proof of the ability to overcome obstacles and to keep going, no matter how tough the journey gets. It is a reminder to take a breath, start over, and believe in the power of 'I can do it'.

This project is a message to everyone embarking on a new journey: You can do it. No matter how many times you stumble or fall, remember, it's all part of the journey. Embrace it, learn from it, and keep moving forward. Because in the end, the triumph of overcoming is the most beautiful part of the story.

## INDIEVERSE

Welcome to Indieverse, your go-to platform for exploring the vibrant world of indie games and their passionate developers. In the vast universe of gaming, Indieverse serves as a cosmic hub where gamers can discover, learn, and connect with unique indie titles that often fly under the radar.

## Overview

In the vast galaxy of gaming, Indieverse stands as a shining constellation dedicated to indie games and their visionary developers.

### Indieverse Layout Design: A Harmonious Blend of Minimalism and Artistry

Indieverse’s layout design is a testament to the harmonious blend of minimalism and artistry. The design philosophy was to create a user interface that is both aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate, while also incorporating a unique visual identity.

The Indieverse logo is prominently displayed on the main page, immediately capturing the user’s attention upon arrival. This strategic placement ensures a consistent brand presence throughout the user’s journey, fostering a cohesive and memorable experience.

The content pages are designed with simplicity in mind. The aim is to present information in a clear and straightforward manner, eliminating unnecessary complexity. The navigation menus are intuitively designed, enabling users to effortlessly access different sections of the website.

The color palette, featuring varying shades of turquoise and pink, creates a visually appealing and “cosy” ambiance. The use of the font from the my all-time favourite game, Legend of Zelda, adds an element of authority, while the vibrant colors keep the webpage looking inviting and warm.

The menu exudes a sense of fun and entertainment, promising users an engaging experience as they navigate through the game reviews - the heart of the Indieverse experience.

In the end, the layout successfully encapsulates the essence of minimalism and creativity. Despite the challenges, the final design aligns with the initial vision, offering users a visually appealing and user-friendly website. Indieverse serves as a testament to the creative journey of blending simplicity with a dash of flair, carving out a unique niche in the vast digital landscape.

For the first time in a long while, I have been able to channel my creativity into a project I love. Indieverse is the product of a creative mind that’s just beginning to shake off the rust and explore its potential.

## Deployment

Deploying Indieverse to GitHub was a challenging yet rewarding journey once again, but practice makes perfect, right?

### Steps to Deploy

1. **Linking Visual Studio Code to GitHub:**
   - To initiate the deployment process, I first linked my Visual Studio Code directory to a GitHub's repository.
   - The steps taken was to push my Directory, through Source Control, creating a new repository in GitHub named 'indieverse'

2. **Adjusting Branch for Deployment:**
   - As part of the deployment setup, I had to adjust the branch settings.
   - I first created a new environment, on the environment's tab;
   - I then configured it to Selected Branch and Tags on the Deployment Branches and Tags section;
   - I added a deployment branch named as the Indieverse's branch: *'main'*;
   - The steps above were provided by Visual Studio Code documentation: [Intro to Git - Publish local repository to GitHub](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/intro-to-git#:~:text=Publish%20local%20repository%20to%20GitHub&text=Use%20the%20Publish%20to%20GitHub,code%20to%20the%20remote%20repository.)

3. **GitHub Pages Deployment:**
   - On Pages tab I changed the branch from None to main;
   - The Main branch selection triggered an automatic refresh, and a detailed ribbon display confirmed the successful deployment.

## Lighthouse Desktop Performance

While I'm proud of the aesthetic and functionality of my webpage, its performance as measured by Google's Lighthouse tool has been a point of frustration. Despite my best efforts to address the issues identified by Lighthouse, achieving a perfect score of 100 without altering the layout of my site has proven to be a challenging task.

I've attempted to address the issues to the best of my ability, but there's still work to be done. I'm committed to learning and improving, so if anyone has insights or suggestions on how to boost my Lighthouse score without compromising the current layout and design of the site, your input would be greatly appreciated. Please feel free to reach out!
